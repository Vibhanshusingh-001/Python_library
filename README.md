# Python_library
A Python library is a collection of pre-written code (modules and packages) that provides functions, classes, and variables to perform specific tasks, allowing developers to reuse code and simplify their programming processes.

Pandas is a powerful and widely-used open-source Python library designed for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning.
It provides flexible and easy-to-use data structures, mainly Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional),
which are essential for handling structured data efficiently.

### Key Features of Pandas
###### Data Structures: Provides Series and DataFrame for structured data.
###### Handling Missing Data: Easy methods to detect, remove, or replace missing data.
###### Data Alignment: Automatically aligns data for operations on different datasets.
###### Data Aggregation: Built-in functions for grouping and summarizing data.
###### Data Cleaning: Methods for handling duplicates, missing values, and type conversions.
###### Data Transformation: Allows reshaping, merging, and pivoting of datasets.
###### Integration: Works well with other libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
###### File I/O: Supports reading and writing data from/to various formats like CSV, Excel, SQL, and JSON.

 NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
 along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is widely used in data science, machine learning,
 scientific computing, and engineering.

### Key Features of NumPy
###### N-Dimensional Arrays: Provides the powerful ndarray object for fast and efficient operations.
###### Mathematical Functions: Includes advanced mathematical functions for linear algebra, statistics, Fourier transforms, etc.
###### Vectorization: Enables faster computations by eliminating the need for explicit loops.
###### Broadcasting: Performs arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes in an intuitive way.
###### Integration: Works seamlessly with other libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
###### Memory Efficient: Consumes less memory and is faster compared to Python lists.
